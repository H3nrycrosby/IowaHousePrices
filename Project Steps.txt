Study the data

1. Read in the file and study all the variables
2. Descriptives on all individual variables:
	a. Determine type of each var
	b. Determine type of each variable (numeric? ordered categories? categorical?)
	b. Summaries - identify variable's central tendency and variance
	c. Visuals of var distribution - skewed? sensored?
	d. For each var - record our observations about it; missing values?
	e. What does our DV look like?

3. Bivariate relationships between each predictor and the DV
	a. Which predictors seem most promising?
	
4. Bivariate relationships among predictors:
	a. Record observations: what predictors seem redundant?
	b. Does it make sense to combine certain predictors into a new predictor?
	c. Hypotheses: Is it reasonable to assume interactions among some predictors

Prepare the dataset for analyses:

1. Transform numeric variables that have weird distributions
2. If needed, build new predictors - combinations of existing variables
3. Create dummy variables for categorical variables
4. Do we have missing values - impute them where possible - best method?
